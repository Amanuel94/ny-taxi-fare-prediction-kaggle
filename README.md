# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction

This project aims to predict taxi fares for New York City using a dataset from Kaggle. It utilizes various machine learning models and data preprocessing techniques to generate accurate fare predictions based on features such as pickup/dropoff locations, date, time, and distance.

## Features:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature engineering (e.g., Haversine distance, time features)
- Machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

## Usage:
Run the `nytaxi.ipynb` notebook to load data, preprocess, train models, and make predictions.

## Dataset:
NYC Taxi Fare Prediction dataset from Kaggle.
